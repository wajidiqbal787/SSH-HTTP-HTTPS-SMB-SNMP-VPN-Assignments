# Network Protocol Assignments — SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, SNMP, VPN

## Overview
This repository contains Wireshark captures and analysis for common network protocols and secure connections:
- **SSH** — Secure Shell traffic analysis  
- **HTTP** — Unencrypted web traffic captures  
- **HTTPS** — Encrypted web traffic, TLS handshake analysis  
- **SMB** — File sharing protocol captures and session analysis  
- **SNMP** — Simple Network Management Protocol captures and queries  
- **VPN** — Virtual Private Network traffic, tunneling overview  

All captures were performed in a **controlled lab environment** for educational purposes only.

## Repository Structure
- `ssh/` — PCAP files, session logs, analysis notes, screenshots  
- `http/` — HTTP traffic captures, request/response examples  
- `https/` — HTTPS/TLS handshake captures, certificate analysis  
- `smb/` — SMB sessions, file transfer examples, PCAPs  
- `snmp/` — SNMP queries, responses, capture logs  
- `vpn/` — VPN setup captures, encrypted tunnel observation  
- `reports/` — Summary of findings and key observations  
- `screenshots/` — Annotated Wireshark screenshots

## Tools & Environment
- **Wireshark** — used to capture and analyze traffic  
- **Test VMs / lab hosts** — client and server on isolated network  
- Services/protocols configured in lab (SSH server, web server, SMB share, SNMP agent, VPN server)  
- VPN: Any lab VPN setup (OpenVPN, WireGuard, or similar)
